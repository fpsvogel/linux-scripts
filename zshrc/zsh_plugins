# My Zsh plugins.
# Essentially I've moved the plugins section of .zshrc over to
# here so that I can easily apply them on a different machine.

# Community plugins must first be installed.

# - zsh-syntax-highlighting:
#     https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md

# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
