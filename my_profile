# TODO: If boot menu timeout reverts to 30s, edit the timeout for efi platform to set timeout=2:
#   sudo nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg
# Automate this here if it needs to be re-applied repeatedly.
# NOTE: To add boot parameters, instead do:
#   sudo nano /etc/default/grub
#   sudo update-grub  # or grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
